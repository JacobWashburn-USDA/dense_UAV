### Interactive Figures ###

* Figure 1. RmB vegetative index correlations and autocorrelations between: [A)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JacobWashburn-USDA/dense_UAV/blob/main/Figures/Fig1A.html) flight dates throughout the season, and [B)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JacobWashburn-USDA/dense_UAV/blob/main/Figures/Fig1B.html) auto-correlations for all pairs of flights and every possible distance between flights across the season in days.
* [Figure 2.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JacobWashburn-USDA/dense_UAV/blob/main/Figures/Fig2.html) Correlations between standard manual phenotypes taken for each plot at a single time point in the season and the vegetative index GmR from flights throughout the season. The few days before and after the average flowering time are highlighted with a gray box.

### Scripts for running analysis ###

To run this analysis you will need to clone the repository onto your computer and install the dependincies required by each script. Scripts are written in R and Python 3 using the jupyter notebooks interface. Scripts for the analysis can be found in the directories "r_scripts" and "Jupyter_notebooks.
